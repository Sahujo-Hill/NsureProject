This is an alternative version with no authentication of my Client Portal project for a mock insurance company: "NSure" that demonstrates my understanding of the Blazor framework and basic coding principle. This project best demonstrates my HTML skills primarily and then my CSS. <br></br>
### It contains:
- Simple but effective, user friendly interface that reflects my original design in Figma
- Good Navigation making an extended use of Blazor's in-built Nav Menu
- Access to a set of mock data for each policy*<br></br>
---

#### Factors I'm happy with:
- Relevant to the industry I work in.
- Demonstrates Understanding of User Needs - Certain company client portals aren't very user friendly, just get the job done
- Navigation
- Pleasant design that enables ease of use
- Helped develop my understanding of Blazor and where things are laid out, pages, components etc.<br></br>

#### Pain points:
- Took me quite a while
- Currently doesn't contain real data
- GitIgnore issue<br></br>

#### What I'd do next:
- *Finish building the NSure api and make calls via this app for real time data interaction with GET/POST/PUT requests
- Make better use of components rather than duplicating code
- Fix GitIgnore<br></br>
